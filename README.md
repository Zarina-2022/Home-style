<h1>This web site is one of my first projects that I did. </1>

<h3>And believe me, it was fun and exciting for me.</h3>

While creating this web page I used such programs as </br> 

HTML and CSS3, thanks to which I got a very attractive </br>

page  with interesting effects. 

<h3> But this project helped me learn even more about </br> 

CSS and HTML </h3>

<h3> I will continue to renew this project as I develop my CSS and HTML. </h3>

<h2> How to install and run the project. </h2>
